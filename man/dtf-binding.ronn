dtf-binding(1) -- View bindings for built-in tools
==================================================

## SYNOPSIS
dtf binding [<dtf_binding>]

## DESCRIPTION  
dtf-binding(1) prints a single dtf binding or all bindings for built-in tools. This lets a modules use the **dtf.included** python class and **dtf_\*** helpers to invoke Android tools such as aapt and apktool.

## EXAMPLES
To print all bindings, run dtf-binding(1) with no arguments:

	$ dtf binding

To print a single binding, supply it as argument 1:

    $ dtf binding dtf_apktool

The purpose of this system is to allow hotswapping of built-in tools. For example, suppose a specific version of smali is desired for a given project. You can edit the file "~/.dtf/included/globals.ini" to reflect this. Now, when using dtf(1), this new tool will be used.
